    <p>Welcome!  We are super excited to get the 2023 cross country season under way!</p>

<p>This is our team website--please check out all the awesome things it has to offer, including historical results, Top 10 Lists, team information and more.</p>

<p>The schedule that is on this website will ultimately be the most complete and accurate schedule as it will be update with actual race times, etc. as we get them.  However, for the time being most of the race times listed are based on historic times and best guesses, and are not times from meet directors.</p>

<p>We will be using Remind to communicate changes and announcements instead of posting those things in this space, so please be sure to be on our Remind group.  This will continue to be a space where we will recognize accomplishments and give big picture items.  Please come back often!</p>
  
    <h2> 2023 Scrimmage </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Sunday, August 13th, 2023</p>
    <p>We kicked our 2023 season off with our "practice" meet, running at the Doherty scrimmage.  With no official times kept, this meet does not count towards official team records, but does count as a great way to start the season.  We had several PRs, some great pack running, and some nice surprises.  Times for our runners are below.</p>

<p>Keaton Morrison-17:48<br />Adrian Estrada Garza-18:33<br />Braeden Perkins-19:10<br />Ayden Merrick-19:54<br />Isaac Wallace-20:02<br />Jose Nelson-21:00<br />Loken Litchfield-21:40</p>

<p>Ana Nelson-22:37<br />Maggi Morrell-22:46<br />Malena Westberg-22:47<br />Gracie Mikan-23:49</p>
