    <h2> Summer Fun </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Wednesday, May 22nd, 2013</p>
    <p>Summer is upon us!</p>

<p>As all cross country coaches and veteran runners can attest, the fall season will be made or broken by what you do between now and August 12. Put in some great mileage over the next three months and you can expect a great fall season. Slack of for the next three months and, well, you can expect your results to be subpar.</p>

<p>Starting Tuesday, May 28th we will meet at 7am at the Widefield High School track to run. On Tuesdays and Thursdays we will lift weights after running.</p>

<p>As important as running over the summer is, we don't want the summer to be all drudgery and no fun. We will kick off the pure fun part of the summer with a team dinner at Coach Nelson's house on May 30th from 6-8 pm. You can get directions at any of our first three summer runs.</p>

<p>Many other fun events will follow. Stay tuned for a complete list of fun events and important summer dates that will be coming soon.</p>

    <p>The Colorado Running Company is offering a special deal to high school cross country runners. Buy a pair of shoes at regular price and get a pair of cross country racing shoes for $15. The offer is good through August 31, but the selection and sizes are limited, so don't wait!</p>
  
    <h2> Scrimmage </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Wednesday, August 21st, 2013</p>
    <p>Our team will see it's first race action at the Lewis Palmer scrimmage this Saturday, August 24th. The scrimmage takes place at Palmer Lake with the boys racing at 8 and the girls racing at 8:45. The bus will leave at 6:30 from WHS. To get to Palmer Lake take I-25 to exit 161 for Monument. Take highway 105 west through Monument and Palmer Lake about 4 miles. The "lake" will be on your right.</p>
  
    <h2> Cheyenne Mountain Stampede </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Tuesday, August 27th, 2013</p>
    <p>Our team runs our first real race of the season this Thursday, Auguts 29th. (Please note: the originally released date of Friday, August 30th was incorrect.) The race takes place at the Penrose Event Center and Bear Creek Park.</p>

<p>Race times will be: JV girls 2:35, JV boys 3:15, Varsity boys 6:00.</p>

<p>There will be a fee for parking at the Penrose Event Center. Costs will be $10 for the closest lot and $5 for the farther lot. You may be able to find parking not on the Event Center property free of charge. However, carpooling is advised.</p>
  
    <h2> Labor Day Practices </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Friday, August 30th, 2013</p>
    <p>We will be practicing at 8am on Saturday and Monday of Labor Day Weekend. If you aren't able to be there make sure you run over the long weekend! In fact, for many of us it probably wouldn't hurt to run Sunday as well!</p>

<p>Enjoy the long weekend!</p>
  
    <h2> Home Meet </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Wednesday, September 4th, 2013</p>
    <p>Our only home meet of the year happens this Friday, September 6. Please come support our team! If you are available to help make sure the meet runs smoothly, please let Coach Nelson know ASAP!</p>
  
    <h2> WHS Cross Country Invite </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Sunday, September 8th, 2013</p>
    <p>Bringing home 12 individual awards and a team trophy, we represented Widefield very well at our home meet. With temperatures in the 90s, the conditions were far from ideal. Continuing the trend established at the Cheyenne Mountain Stampede, this year's version of WHSXC continued to run hard, compete, and persevere in tough conditions rather than folding in challenging circumstances.</p>

<p>This Tuesday brings the Florence Husky Invitational and a forecast calling for temperatures in the low 70s  and 50% chance of showers. As long as lightening stays away, the favorable conditions could give us a great chance to see what we can really do!</p>

<p>Be sure to talk to your teachers about missing 7th hour on Tuesday!</p>
  
    <h2> League race times </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Monday, October 7th, 2013</p>
