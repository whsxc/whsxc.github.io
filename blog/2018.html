    <h2> 2018 Pre-Season & Practice Info </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Saturday, July 28th, 2018</p>
    <p>The beginning of cross country season will be different this year than in years past. First, the season starts a week earlier than normal, with the first day of practice on August 6th. This means there will be 7 days of practice before school starts instead of the normal 2. It means opportunities to get a physical and do athletic paperwork are running short. It also means we can continue to practice in the morning for most of the first week since teachers will not be back at work yet.</p>

<p>Below you will find reminders and plans for the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>July 30- August 3: Pre-Season “Camp.”<br />-Traditionally our camp simply consists of going different places to run during the week. This year we will continue to meet in the morning, at 7am Monday thru Thursday and 8am on Friday. On Monday we will carpool to Red Rock Open Space off highway 24 near Manitou Springs and Old Colorado City. Tuesday we will stay at the school to run. On Wednesday we will carpool to North Monument Valley Park. Thursday we will stay at the school. And Friday we will meet at 8 to carpool down to the Fountain Creek Regional Park Ponds. We may be in need of drivers to help with the carpooling each day. Parents, if you are available to drive on Monday, Wednesday or Friday please show up at the appointed time at the Gladiator!</p>

<p>August 1: Parent/Athlete Athletic meeting at 6:30 in the library.</p>

<p>August 4: Run for Rwanda and physicals<br />Run for Rwanda: 8am at Cottonwood Creek Park<br />Physicals: 10am in Bowers Gym. Boys and girls. Physicals will be done when all student/athletes are done, so do not dawdle on getting there from the Run for Rwanda!</p>

    <h2> Cheyenne Mountain Stampede </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Tuesday, August 21st, 2018</p>
    <p>The 2018 cross country season opens at the Cheyenne Mountain Stampede on Friday, August 24.  The Stampede takes place at the Norris Penrose Event Center.  This is the same course that will be used for State, so it will be a full day of cross country as this is the only chance for anyone to run the entire State course before State.</p>

    <h2> Rock Canyon </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Sunday, September 9th, 2018</p>
    <p>Attention Parents!</p>

<p>There has been some confusion over the timing of the Rock Canyon meet on September 15th.  The schedule originally published on the Widefield High School sports page had a start time of 8:30pm.  The meet starts at 8:30am.  This is and has been correct on the schedule on whsxc.com.  Race times for Rock Canyon will be as follows:</p>

<p>8:30am--Varsity Boys<br />9:00am--Varsity Girls<br />9:30am--JV Boys<br />10:00am--JV Girls</p>

    <h2> Northfield Nighthawk Invitational </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Monday, September 24th, 2018</p>
    <p>Our next meet is the Northfield Nighthawk Invitational, on Friday, September 28 at Dicks Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, CO. This meet promises to be a cool experience as it is run under the lights around the practice soccer fields surrounding the stadium and ends inside the stadium. Our race times are:<br />6:00 JV Girls<br />6:30 JV Boys<br />7:00 Varsity Girls<br />7:30 Varsity Boys<br />Because we are traveling to the heart of Denver on a Friday night we will be leaving at 2:00 to ensure we make it on time accounting for Denver traffic. All athletes need to pack a substantial snack/ light dinner to eat before they run. We will stop for dinner on the way home, meaning it will be a late night, with arrival at the school expected to be after 11pm.</p>

<p><b>Please Note!!</b><br />There are specific parking directions for buses and spectators.  From the meet director:<br />All bus and spectator parking MUST be in the north dirt lot off Prairie Parkway.  Many of the roads coming into Dick’s Sporting Goods Park will be CLOSED.  The only way to access parking will be off Prairie Parkway.  The ideal way to access Prairie Parkway will be off Quebec St.  Head east on Prairie Parkway off Quebec St. to access the dirt lot reserved for Cross Country Event Parking.</p>
