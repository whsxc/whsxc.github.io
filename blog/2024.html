    <p>Congratulations to everyone who ran at the scrimmage this morning. We had some very good and exciting things happen. Please see the results and highlights below.</p>

<p>Jose Nelson and Gracie Mikan both ran under the Automatic Letter Time and led the team for the first time ever.</p>

<p>Isaac Wallace ran over a minute faster than he did at this race last year. He and Jose did a nice job feeding off of one another and pushing each other.</p>

<p>Aidan and Jayden both ran under 20:00 to start the season.  For Jayden this is over 90 seconds faster than he started last season.  For Aidan it was a very good start for his first ever 5k.</p>

<p>Lexi was less than 45 second from the Automatic Letter Time in her first every 5k!</p>

<p>Ayden ran his first race since he began dealing with health issues last winter and did so very successfully.</p>

<p>Khawaun, Gabbi, Bri, and Marley all completed their first high school 5k in an impressive manner.  For Khawaun today's race capped off his very first week of high school running.  For the ladies this was a very solid starting point of what will undoubtedly be a season full of big improvements.</p>

<p>Great job to everyone who competed today!  The times we got for everyone are below.</p>

<p>We encourage everyone to go for a long run together this weekend.  For those who raced today that run should be at a relaxed pace but long enough to qualify as a long run.</p>

<p>Enjoy the rest of your weekend!  See you on Monday!</p>
