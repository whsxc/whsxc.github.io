    <h2> State 2020 </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Sunday, January 17th, 2021</p>
    <p>The 2020 cross country season came to a successful end as Sophia Mena and Asher Finch both qualified to compete at the State Championship meet!</p>

<p>Sophia finished 8th at Regionals to qualify while Asher finished 12th.</p>

<p>This was the 8th season in a row that at least one member of WHSXC has qualified for State.</p>

<p>Things look optimistic for keeping the streak going in 2021.  Dylan Palmer, Kris Palmer and Keaton Morrison will be the 17th, 18th and 20th returning finishers from our region next year and in normal years the top 15 runners qualify for State.  Maggie Morrell will be the 17th fastest returning girl in our region next year.  In addition, we have a number of incoming freshmen coming from the Junior Highs who will help our team's make a push to qualify for State next year.</p>

<p>Congratulations to Asher and Sophia for continuing the WHSXC legacy of success!  The future looks bright for keeping success going!</p>
  
    <h2> Winter/Spring Running 2021 </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Sunday, February 7th, 2021</p>
    <p>Looking ahead, this crazy Covid year is going to be further impacted by the schedule of track and cross country.  Basically, we normally start our summer running the day after Memorial Day.  Our system of doing winter sports or running in the winter, having a focused, competitive track season, and then having a great summer of running with a focus on building and recovering has a history of yielding great results for people who work it.  However, this year track will be in full swing on Memorial Day.  So, we have to adjust.</p>

<p>Our plan from now until cross country will look like this:</p>

<p>Starting on Monday, February 8th we will have an 11 week build up to track.  This is when we will focus on mileage, building and recovering, and earn Mile Club shirts.  Basically this will be what our summer normally is.  For those who are doing winter sports at this time, Mile Club can still be earned in the 11 week period starting when their season is over.</p>

<p>Track starts on April 26 and ends on June 26.  We will start running again after a week or 2 off after track to get ready for cross country, which is scheduled to start on August 9.</p>

<p>It is impossible to overstate how important the next 11 weeks of running are.  All of our success in track and in cross country next year will be determined between now and April 26.  It is going to be challenging:  there are cold days ahead, probably accompanied by snow and wind.  This is not the easiest time to get in miles.  But, it will be hard for everyone in the state.  Those who are committed, tough, and determined and find a way to get in a great 11 week training period will have an advantage over everyone in the state who lets the elements get the better of them.  Our path back to qualifying our teams for State next year goes through consistently running, building, and working over the next 11 weeks.</p>

<p>For the first week or 2 of our winter/spring running, we will be running as WHS athletes.  However, we are working with the Community Center to create a community youth running club so we can involve more runners from more grades in our plan.  When we transition to the community running club, all participants will need to register through the Community Center.  Registration will be $20.</p>

<p>We will meet in front of the main entrance to the Community Center to run at 3:30 on Mondays and Thursdays starting February 8th.  Be early to stretch on your own so we can start running right at 3:30.</p>

<p>Until further notice, this is the plan:  Mondays and Thursdays from 3:30 to 4:30 meeting in front of the Community Center.  Everyone needs to wear a mask until they start running and will have to answer all screening questions.  As always these days, if you don't feel well, stay home.</p>

<p>This is the way.</p>
  
    <h2> Summer Running, 2021 </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Thursday, May 13th, 2021</p>
    <p>Summer Cross Country training will take place with the following schedule:</p>

<p>June 1 thru July 30:  Monday thru Thursday at 7am.  Meet under the trees in the south-west corner of the grass practice fields near the discus ring and gate to Widefield Elementary. Plan on being picked up by 8:30 unless otherwise notified.</p>

<p>July 9-30:  Fridays at 7am, meet at Bear Creek Park at the administration building parking lot off of W. Rio Grande St. and Creek Crossing St.</p>

<p>August 2-6:  Pre-season camp.  Details to be announced.</p>

<p>August 9:  First day of practice.</p>

<p>*Please dress appropriately and bring a water bottle every day. While masks are not currently required for outdoor activities, mask wearing and social distancing will be encouraged while not running to ensure the health and safety of all participants.</p>

<p>Summer Mileage Clubs: Many of our most successful runners base their summer running around our Mileage Clubs. Runners who run 300, 400 (girls only), or 500 miles over the summer will receive a Mile Club shirt at the end of the summer. We have specific guidelines on the best way to accomplish this feat while staying healthy and ensuring a good season. Summer miles can be tracked over any consecutive 11 week period from February 8 through August 14th. Please see the Mile Club sections of this site or ask a coach for more information.</p>

    <h2> Scrimmage, 2021 </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Saturday, August 14th, 2021</p>
    <p>After 21 months we were able to get back to normal cross country running at Monument Valley Park today for the Doherty Spartan Never Alone Foundation scrimmage.  Being early in the season, expectations were low and process oriented.  Nonetheless, we had some great performances including a few PRs and some well executed race plans.  Since it was a scrimmage and scrimmages are not allowed to have official stats kept, results will not be posted to athletes.  However, hand-held approximate times are below.  Way to get the season off to a great start, Gladiators!<br />1 Mile (first mile)<br />Ana Nelson:  7:43<br />Adrian Estrada Garza:  7:41<br />Sam Doolittle:  11:48<br />Jesse Kronberg:  10:10<br />Samantha Kronberg:  10:49<br />2 Mile<br />Nathan Maloukis:  13:42<br />Luis Turner:  17:30<br />Lili Velazquez:  17:41<br />5k<br />Ethan Kimminau:  17:39<br />Keaton Morrison:  18:21<br />Kris Palmer:  19:32<br />Dylan Palmer:  20:37<br />Ryan Vsetecka:  21:04<br />Landon Johnson:  21:18<br />Cassie Nelson:  24:51<br />Rose Cox:  24:28<br />Alyssa Like:  28:06</p>
