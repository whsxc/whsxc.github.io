    <h2> Pre-Season Camp 2017, etc. </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Thursday, July 27th, 2017</p>
    <p>The 2017 cross country season is nearly upon us!  Last year was the greatest season in team history and this year promises to be another great season.  To get a head start we have several events coming up.</p>

<p>First, we have the last two road race opportunities of the summer.  On July 29 the Classic 10k and 5k are run in Colorado Springs.  The following week, on August 5th, the Run for Rwanda happens at Cottonwood Creek Park.  The Run for Rwanda has traditionally been a good jump start for the season and a chance for high school runners to see where they are at in a friendly atmosphere.  Any runner who is serious about having a great season is encouraged to run in one of these races.</p>

<p>The week of August 7-11 we will have our pre-season camp.  Camp takes place at various locations around Colorado springs.  Please see our <a href="http://whsxc.com//preseasoncamp2017/">pre-season camp</a> page for details!</p>
  
    <h2> Let's Get It Started </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Tuesday, August 22nd, 2017</p>
    <p>The Cheyenne Mountain Stampede/Pre-State Meet is quickly approaching!</p>

<p>On Friday, August 25 we will open the season at the Norris Penrose Event Center and Bear Creek Regional Park.  This will be a day jam packed with cross country action!  Our team will be running in 6 different races starting at 2:30 and going until 7:00.  It will be a long day, so please plan ahead!  Parents, there is a charge for parking, so please arrive early and be prepared.</p>

<p>Race times will be as follows:<br />2:30--Novice girls (1.5+ miles)<br />4:00--4A Open girls<br />4:30--4A Varsity girls<br />5:00--Novice boys<br />6:30--4A Open boys<br />7:00--4A Varsity boys</p>

<p>This is the only chance for our athletes and parents to preview the State course, so be sure to be there!</p>
  
    <h2> Widefield Invite </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Monday, September 11th, 2017</p>
    <p>For the fourth year in a row the boys took home the team and individual titles at the Widefield Cross Country Invitational. Cole Munoz led the way as 8 of the top 10 places were claimed by the Gladiators.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, the girls won both the team and individual titles for the first time in meet history with Maddy Rodrigues taking the win and leading a parade of finishers as the ladies went 1-2-3-5-10.</p>

<p>Next up before our trip to Durango is the Florence Husky Invite on Tuesday. Boys will race at 4 and girls at 4:30.</p>
  
    <h2> JV vs. Varsity </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Wednesday, September 13th, 2017</p>
    <p>The Florence Husky Invitational is many things:  Flat.  Exposed.  Enigmatic.</p>

<p>Over the years we have had fantastic performances at the Florence Husky and we have had disappointing performances.  We have sent Varsity runners who have dominated and have left Varsity at home with mixed levels of success.</p>

<p>This year was another mixed bag.</p>

<p>It was hot.  The course did not run fast.  But, our JV boys beat all of the varsity teams assembled.  This fact in and of itself made the meet a great success.  Anytime your 7-11 runners beat every other team's 1-5 runners you can feel good about yourself.</p>

<p>Up next we will be taking the qualifying members of our team to the Southwest Sunset Classic in Durango, Colorado.  Girls will race at 8:30 and boys at 9:00.  All races will be under the lights on the Hilcrest Golf Course.</p>
  
    <h2> Canon City--Cancelled </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Thursday, September 28th, 2017</p>
    <p>The meet scheduled for September 28 at the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park has been cancelled due to inclement weather.</p>

<p>Our next meet is the Rampart Foxes and Hounds on Saturday, September 30.  This meet takes place at Cottonwood Creek Park in Colorado Springs and features a unique and cool scoring system.  Race times will be:<br />8:45--JV Girls<br />9:20--JV Boys<br />9:50--Varsity Girls<br />10:20--Varsity Boys<br />10:50--Open Boys<br />10:55--Open Girls</p>
  
    <h2> Doherty Spartan Invite </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Monday, October 2nd, 2017</p>
    <p>The Doherty Spartan Invite takes place on Thursday, October 6.  This is our last invitational meet before Championship Season.  The meet takes place at Bear Creek Park, but is not the same course as that used for State.  Parents should park either in the neighborhood North of the park off of Rio Grande, or in the Bear Creek parking lots west of the park and west of 21st.  The start and finish areas are near the Administration Building off of Cross Creek Dr.</p>

<p>Race times will be:<br />2:00 JV Girls<br />2:45 JV Boys<br />3:30 Varsity Girls<br />4:00 Varsity Boys</p>
  
    <h2> JV Championships and Regionals </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Friday, October 13th, 2017</p>
    <p>This next week will be the last week of the cross country season for all runners who do not qualify for State.  We have a meet for our JV runners on Tuesday at Monument Valley Park.  Start times for that race will be 3:30 for boys and 4:10 for girls.</p>

<p>On Tuesday our Varsity runners will compete at Regionals with a berth to the State Championships on the line.  Regionals are in Durango on the same course we ran on in mid-September.  Boys run at 2:00 and girls run at 2:30.</p>

<p>Let's finish the season strong with good performances at our last meets!</p>
  
    <h2> State-Bound! </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Friday, October 20th, 2017</p>
    <p>For the second year in a row both the boys and girls have qualified for State as a team!</p>

<p>At regionals the boys were led by Cole Mu√±oz who ran to the first individual Regional title in recent history. Sophia Mena led the girls pack as our top four girls were separated by a mere 35 seconds!</p>

<p>The State Meet will take place on Saturday, October 28 at Noris Penrose Event Center. Girls race at noon and boys race at 1:20.</p>
  
    <h2> State Week Plans </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Wednesday, October 25th, 2017</p>
    <p>State week is part celebration, part managing excitement and energy, and part preparation.</p>

<p>To this end, we are going to have a "family breakfast" Saturday morning before departing for State.  We will eat in the WHS cafeteria starting at 8:30am.  Pancakes will be the main dish with assorted sides available as well.  The girls will eat first since they race first.</p>

<p>Family and team members are welcome to attend the breakfast.  Donations to offset the cost of the meal will be accepted but there will be no charge.</p>

<p>At 10:00 we will depart for State.  For parents who are attending State, please be aware there is a $10 charge for parking at the State meet.</p>

<p>Girls race at noon and boys race at 1:20.</p>

<p>See you Saturday!</p>
