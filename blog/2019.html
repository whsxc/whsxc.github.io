    <h2> 2019 XC Season Info </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Saturday, August 3rd, 2019</p>
    <p>The 2019 season is upon us. The first official practice of the season will be on Monday, August 12 at 2:55 at the Widefield track. Before the first practice, there are some things all runners should be aware of.</p>

<p>First, the week of August 5-9 will be our “Pre-Season Camp.” This simply mean we will be transitioning our pre-season training to being more focused as well as more fun. On Monday thru Thursday we will be meeting at the Gladiator at 7am to car pool to various parks around town to run. On Friday we will meet at 3:15pm. Any parents who are available to help drive would be appreciated.</p>

<p>In order to practice with the team on August 12 you will need your yellow card. To get a yellow card you must have your athletic paperwork done with your parents signatures, along with a current physical. Sports physicals will be available at the WHS gym on Saturday, August 10 at 10am. These physicals must be paid for with cash. All paperwork needs to be turned in to the main office for the yellow card. It can also be turned in at the time of the physicals.</p>

<p>There will be a parents meeting on Tuesday, August 6 at 6:30pm in the WHS auditorium. Parents can get athletic paperwork at this time as well as get any questions answered about sports at WHS in general and WHSXC in particular.</p>

<p>We can’t wait to see everyone soon!</p>
