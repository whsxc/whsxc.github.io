    <h2> Scrimmage 2024 </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Saturday, August 17th, 2024</p>
    <p>Congratulations to everyone who ran at the scrimmage this morning. We had some very good and exciting things happen. Please see the results and highlights below.</p>

<p>Jose Nelson and Gracie Mikan both ran under the Automatic Letter Time and led the team for the first time ever.</p>

<p>Isaac Wallace ran over a minute faster than he did at this race last year. He and Jose did a nice job feeding off of one another and pushing each other.</p>

<p>Aidan and Jayden both ran under 20:00 to start the season.  For Jayden this is over 90 seconds faster than he started last season.  For Aidan it was a very good start for his first ever 5k.</p>

<p>Lexi was less than 45 second from the Automatic Letter Time in her first every 5k!</p>

<p>Ayden ran his first race since he began dealing with health issues last winter and did so very successfully.</p>

<p>Khawaun, Gabbi, Bri, and Marley all completed their first high school 5k in an impressive manner.  For Khawaun today's race capped off his very first week of high school running.  For the ladies this was a very solid starting point of what will undoubtedly be a season full of big improvements.</p>

<p>Great job to everyone who competed today!  The times we got for everyone are below.</p>

<p>Runner                            Mile 1                  Mile 2               Final Time<br />Jose Nelson                   5:54                    12:00                 18:42<br />Isaac Wallace                5:50                    12:00                 18:55<br />Aiden Estrada Garza    6:16                     12:40                  19:50<br />Jayden Gomez              6:17                     12:57                  19:56<br />Ayden Merrick               6:39                    14:11                    22:13<br />Khawaun Baptiste         7:05                   15:06                  23:24</p>

<p>We encourage everyone to go for a long run together this weekend.  For those who raced today that run should be at a relaxed pace but long enough to qualify as a long run.</p>

<p>Enjoy the rest of your weekend!  See you on Monday!</p>

    <h2> Welcome to WHSXC 2023 </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Friday, July 28th, 2023</p>
    <p>Welcome!  We are super excited to get the 2023 cross country season under way!</p>

<p>This is our team website--please check out all the awesome things it has to offer, including historical results, Top 10 Lists, team information and more.</p>

<p>The schedule that is on this website will ultimately be the most complete and accurate schedule as it will be update with actual race times, etc. as we get them.  However, for the time being most of the race times listed are based on historic times and best guesses, and are not times from meet directors.</p>

<p>We will be using Remind to communicate changes and announcements instead of posting those things in this space, so please be sure to be on our Remind group.  This will continue to be a space where we will recognize accomplishments and give big picture items.  Please come back often!</p>
  
    <h2> Air Academy Info </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Tuesday, September 13th, 2022</p>
    <p>On Saturday, September 17th we will be racing at the Kadet Invitational at Air Academy High School.  Race times are as follows:</p>

<p>Boys Varsity:  9:00<br />Girls Varsity:  9:40<br />Boys JV:  10:20<br />Girls JV:  11:00</p>

<p>Below is info given to us from Air Academy High School regarding accessing the school which is located on the Air Force Academy grounds:</p>

<p>All visitors must enter through the South Gate (Exit #150) – Academy Blvd.  Upon arrival to the security checkpoint the driver of the vehicle will state the name of the contest they are attending and provide them with a current driver’s license.  They could also ask for your current vehicle registration and/or current proof of insurance.  Everyone is subject to search when entering this federal installation.  They may ask to open the trunk and/or perform a cursory check of the interior of the vehicle.  You have the right to refuse such an inspection, however will not be allowed to enter.  Drugs (to include medical marijuana), weapons, ammunition and explosives are not allowed at Air Academy events. Please know that we are very grateful to the USAFA for working with us on this issue.  Please help us support their mission in keeping the USAFA a safe and secure military installation.</p>

<p>Parking for spectators is located in the large student lot located directly North of the high school. Lots of parking is available, but keep in mind that Air Academy High School is accessed by a single road and wait times are common. Plan on arriving early to avoid delays at the gate and on the Academy!</p>
  
    <h2> Alamosa Info </h2>
		<p class="blog-meta">Thursday, September 8th, 2022</p>
    <p>Below is some info for this Saturday's meet in Alamosa. Please read it all and be prepared!</p>

<p>-The meet is at Cattails Golf Course at 500 Cottonwood Dr., Alamosa, CO81101.</p>

<p>-The bus is leaving WHS at 5:45am Saturday morning. Be at the school by 5:30 so we can be loaded and ready to go. Anyone arriving after the bus is loaded and ready to leave will miss the bus.</p>

<p>-Race times: Boys 9:20, Girls 10:25. All boys will run in the same race as will all girls. Collegiate races happen during the gap between Varsity Boys and Girls. Boys awards will happen at 11:10 with girls awards following at 11:20.</p>

<p>-There is a lot of time between our departure and our races, so everyone needs to have a substantial snack to eat on the bus or as we get to Alamosa. Start hydrating now, but don't drink too much water before getting on the bus--we will only make one bathroom stop on the way.</p>

<p>-The team will provide pizza for lunch before we leave Alamosa. Anyone who does not like pizza or has dietary restrictions should bring a lunch.</p>

<p>-Assuming no changes in the race schedule, we expect to leave the race around 11:30, be on the road after lunch around 12:30, and return home in the neighborhood of 3-3:30pm.</p>

<p>-The weather in Alamosa is forecast to be drastically different on Saturday than it has been the last several days at home. It could be in the 40s when we get off the bus and should never get hotter than 70. Grass could be wet when we arrive. Bring extra socks, extra layers, and be prepared to stay warm if it is chilly. It could be great racing weather, but less than ideal standing-around-waiting-to-race weather.</p>
